## FAQ

Can I pass the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional test if I don't have any practical experience?

Yes, this is very feasible, and many of my students have done it although AWS recommends two or more years of experience for applicants, and while you may quickly get by with less, it is strongly advised to have as much hands-on experience as possible. So, make sure you enroll in a hands-on training session!

Is there anything the student needs to know before taking the exam?

There are no longer any requirements. If you don't have much industry experience dealing with AWS services, I would recommend starting with the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate. My best advice is to start [AWS training] with all [AWS associate-level certificates course] since the information obtained will be precious.
